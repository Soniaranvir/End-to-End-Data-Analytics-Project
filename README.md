# 🛒 Walmart Data Analytics Project

## ✨ Overview

Walmart is one of the world’s largest retailers, handling vast amounts of transactional data across multiple branches. This project focuses on analyzing Walmart’s sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Tableau, we explored the dataset and created visualizations to drive actionable decisions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Retail businesses like Walmart often struggle with:

- Understanding customer preferences and payment patterns.

- Identifying high-performing and low-performing branches or products.

- Spotting revenue trends and seasonal changes.

- Optimizing inventory and marketing strategies based on demand.

This project aims to address these challenges by extracting meaningful insights from Walmart’s sales data.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used

Database Management: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)

Programming Language: Python (Data cleaning and preparation)

Visualization: Tableau (Interactive charts and graphs)

## 🔑 Key Insights
